Overview

This project is a practical application of the skills I learned in my Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

Project Goal: "Allow List Updater"

I built a Python algorithm to manage a text file of IP addresses that have access to restricted information. The tool automatically removes IP addresses that should no longer have access.

Key Python Functions Used:

.with open(): Safely handles opening and closing security files.

.split(): Converts raw text strings into a list for easy searching.

.remove(): Deletes unauthorized users from the access list.

.write(): Saves the updated, secure list back to the system.
